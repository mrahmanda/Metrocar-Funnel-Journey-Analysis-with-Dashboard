Final dashboard was uploaded to Tableau public and can be accessed fro README.md file.

I will finish this article answering business questions using this dashboard.


### What steps of the funnel should we research and improve? Are there any specific drop-off points preventing users from completing their first ride?


Metrocar should further investigate what is happening for certain users between the ride accepted stage to ride completed stage as there is a 49% users dropoff.

It would also be interesting to investigate the drop-off happening from downloads to signup.

However, I would suggest that the most relevant drop-off point to focus on would be from signup to ride request in case of unique users funnel, and the dropoff from ride requested to ride accepted in case of rides funnel. As changes in these two stages would result in relevant changes in business results.


### Metrocar currently supports 3 different platforms: ios, android, and web. To recommend where to focus our marketing budget for the upcoming year, what insights can we make based on the platform?


Revenue and number of trips per platform query result
A 60% of trips and revenue comes from IOS users. Thus, my recommendation would be to focus marketing budget in acquiring and retaining users from this platform. Query in GitHub


### What age groups perform best at each stage of our funnel? Which age group(s) likely contain our target customers?


The age groups that best perform are the 35–44 group followed by 25–34 group.

The 35–44 group is probably our target customer as it is the cohort that most revenue brought.


### Surge pricing is the practice of increasing the price of goods or services when there is the greatest demand for them. If we want to adopt a price-surging strategy, what does the distribution of ride requests look like throughout the day?


As trip distribution shows, there are two activity peaks. One between 8AM and 9AM the other one between 4PM and 7PM. These peaks could be due to working hours.


### What part of our funnel has the lowest conversion rate? What can we do to improve this part of the funnel?


The lowest conversion rate in users funnel occur in the step that goes from ride accepted to ride completed. Some further research would be needed to determine what is happening and how this situation could be improved.

The lowest conversion rate in rides funnel occur in the step that goes from requested ride to accepted ride, this could be due to lack of drivers in certain areas or hours. Further investigation would be needed to determine exact cause thus a way to improve this part of the funnel.
